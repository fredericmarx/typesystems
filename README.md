# What fonts does the Web want? Crafting efficient type systems.

## Abstract

The Web, like every medium or material, imprints itself in the products we build with it. In regards to typography, this happens mostly due to technical implications, but also through the way the language of CSS shapes how we think about fonts.

Typography on the Web has come a long way since font properties were first specified in CSS. Since then we've been facing new creative opportunities through `@font-face` and increasing OpenType support, but also new challenges, like managing webfont performance.

This talk re-evaluates the ways we select, combine and prepare fonts for the Web to create beautiful and performant typographic designs.

You will learn how to find the right typeface for the right job, how to make the most out of each web font, how to keep a typographic performance budget and how to fill the gaps with system fonts.
